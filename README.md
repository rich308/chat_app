# Tippin's Messenger Demo (Major overhaul coming soon)
Laravel 7 messenger demo app by Richard Tippin. Working to release this messenger as a package for use with laravel. This is a fully featured stand alone app you can use as a demo or extract my source to fit your needs.

I will be starting to update this project with an entire new backend by mid December. If you wish to see my OG project and install docs, please refer to my alpha branch:
